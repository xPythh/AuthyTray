# AuthyTray
 Because Authy doesnt provide a Try icon (run in background), i made an app to do it

Run as administrator to install the program at startup

Left click the tray icon to show / hide Authy

Right click the tray icon to close the application

**Note: Authy is not really run in tray, its being ran/killed by the script**

**Note**: Program is added to __C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup__ for startup
